Project 6 for Udacity - Android Basics Nanodegree Program

This is a News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.
To achieve this, I used the Guardian API. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills I've practiced throughout the Networking course. They include:

- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the JSON response
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Using an AsyncTask and Loader
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
